# Alexander Flaherty Console Finances Javascript Exercise


## Description
My intention with this project was to analyze the financial records of a company with a financial dataset they have provided in the form of a nested array. The analysis I had to provide included:

* Total months within the dataset.

* Total net profit within the dataset.

* The average of the changes in profit/losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profit/losses in a month.

* The greatest decrease in profit/losses in a month.

I then needed to output this as a concatenated string within the console log to be read by the user.

The site is deployed [here.](https://pazoraf.github.io/Console-Finances-Alexander-Flaherty/)
